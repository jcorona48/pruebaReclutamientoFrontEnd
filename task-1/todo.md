# ðŸ“š Task 1 - Fundamental Programming
Write a function to reverse the elements of a given array while keeping special characters in their original positions. The function should handle dynamic changes in the array and special character positions. For example:

## Input:

~~~
['n', 2, '&', 'a', 'l', 9, '$', 'q', 47, 'i', 'a', 'j', 'b', 'z', '%', 8]
~~~

## Output:

~~~
[8, 'z', '&', 'b', 'j', 'a', '$', 'i', 47, 'q', 9, 'l', 'a', 2, '%', 'n']
~~~

## Note:
